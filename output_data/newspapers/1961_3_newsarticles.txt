"1"	1225	1961	3	"Kritik af udsendelsen"	"Holbæk Amts Venstreblad"	"1961-3-13"	"The article is by civil engineer Heinz Hansen from Jyllinge. The newspaper Politiken has received several submissions from dissatisfied viewers of the program \"Kortene på bordet,\" which addresses the problems of nuclear war. Hansen criticizes the broadcast for focusing solely on the effects of bombs of various sizes. He argues that the program fails to mention that U.S. strategic bombers, which are constantly patrolling European airspace, can carry two bombs of 50,000 kilotons each. Hansen believes that civil defense is 15 years outdated."	"Negative"
"2"	1236	1961	3	"Talt og skrevet. Dybeste beklagelse"	"Land og Folk"	"1961-3-18"	"The article contains a statement from the Christian Peace Federation (Kristeligt Fredsforbund), which is based on the TV programme ‘Cards on the table’ (Kortene på bordet), which deals with the consequences of a nuclear attack on Denmark. The Christian Peace Federation believes that the programme lacked information and spread a false sense of security among the population. They mention four main thoughts: ‘The small size of the bomb. Presumption of premonition. An intact civil defence. The lack of information about the health, genetic and occupational consequences of radioactive fallout.’"	"Different opinions"
