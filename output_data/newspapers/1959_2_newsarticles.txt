In contrast, the Soviet Union believes the opposite. The writer (whose name cannot be found) argues that Denmark has neglected its civil defense and public education. A civil defense is essential, and a military defense cannot stand alone without civil defense. It is important to have a strong civil defense if NATO is to be maintained as a peacekeeping factor. Therefore, it should be built around education about the dangers of nuclear weapons and how to avoid them."	"Mixed | Wants more"
