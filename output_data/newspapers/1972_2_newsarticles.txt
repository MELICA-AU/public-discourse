This proposal will increase the cost of the municipal food laboratory by 300,000 DKK, which will be covered by the state rather than the municipality. The Danish Health Authority is positive about the proposal, as they are already in the process of building shelters for the laboratory staff. However, they would like the basements for the shelters to also be used for the laboratory's work on a daily basis."	"Positive"
