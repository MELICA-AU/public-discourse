The district chairman, school principal Fr. Sørensen, stated at a representatives' meeting in Sønderborg that to maintain interest, they must put in significant effort through information dissemination. The training for rural auxiliary services and first aid has been successful despite the lack of instructors. However, in the town, first aid and fire-fighting training have been heavily affected by the instructor shortage. This situation is improving as the national leadership is now focusing on training new emergency instructors instead of relying solely on specialized instructors. In Sønderborg, two civil defense exercises and courses have been held with 79 participants, while in the rural areas, two courses and exercises have been conducted with 863 participants."
