"Holbæk Amts Venstreblad"	"1969-10-22"	"The civil defense in Nykøbing, in collaboration with Nykøbing Municipality's engineering office, is set to investigate how many of the city's basements could be used as shelters in the event of war. CF leader Leif Lorens Hansen recently attended the civil defense school in Snekkersten, where they considered introducing computers (EDB) to calculate how many people are located in a single neighborhood of the city. However, according to Leif Lorens Hansen, it is uncertain when the investigation will take place. He believes it will most likely happen in the spring, when the engineering office has more time."
