Parts of the article use the pronoun “They” (\"De\"), so it is very directly written to the reader to come forward. The chairman of the civil defense association, department engineer Jørgen Christiansen stated that there is a lack of volunteers in the two branches, which means that the civil defense will have a hard time solving its tasks. The article also goes into more practical aspects of the training and mentions that Danish women without young children can volunteer."	"Different opinions"
