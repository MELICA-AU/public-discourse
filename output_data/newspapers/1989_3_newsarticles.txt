In light of the lack of renewal of the political agreement on civil defense, Sørensen argues that civil defense has not kept up with modern developments—particularly highlighting the municipal civil defense, which he sees as rooted in the threat landscape of World War II. He contends that military units are more likely to be targeted in hostile attacks rather than the civilian population. Sørensen describes municipal civil defense as inefficient and unnecessary in both wartime and peacetime. Instead, he advocates for focusing on mobile units in constant readiness, capable of rapid deployment, along with improved prevention measures such as warning systems, shelters, and public information.  
In a future civil defense agreement, Sørensen suggests that municipal civil defense should be updated to address contemporary challenges and better integrated with existing municipal emergency services. The focus should be on prevention, strengthening state-level units for peacetime disasters, and making more effective use of resources. The current system, he concludes, is outdated and in need of reform."	"Different opinions"
