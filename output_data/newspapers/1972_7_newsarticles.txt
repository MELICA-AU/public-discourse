In the years 1971-72, it is reported that the civil defense has 129 conscripts and 54 volunteers. The volunteers consist of both men and women, who are required to undergo training lasting 30-40 hours, which takes place locally. The equipment of Odder’s civil defense mostly meets the requirements set by the civil defense authority for an area of Odder’s size. However, if the vehicle fleet of the civil defense or fire department is expanded, there will be issues with garage space."	"Different opinions"

A municipal parking garage on Madevej in the center of Åbenrå is facing a lack of interest from people for its parking spaces. The top floor of the garage has been made available to the local civil defense, which uses it as a storage facility, something they are quite pleased with. The ground floor is used for cars during peacetime but also serves as a shelter for 300 people if needed."	"Neutral"
