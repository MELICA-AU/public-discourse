The debate over arming or not stems from an incident a few years ago when British paratroopers destroyed and attacked a civil defense convoy during a NATO exercise. The International Committee of the Red Cross has stated that arming the civil defense for self-defense and police tasks does not strip it of its civilian nature. However, the civil defense rejects arming. The newspaper writes that this stance aligns with the Danish perception of civil defense as a humanitarian organization, and that few wish to see this status changed. Nonetheless, civil defense still cooperates with military defense in certain areas. The newspaper believes that the civil defense's position on refusing armament is driven by a desire to continue their work and retain their equipment during a war in Denmark."	"Different opinions"
