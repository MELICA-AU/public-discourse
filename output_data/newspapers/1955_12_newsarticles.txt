The Conservative Party demands savings in the state budget and postponement of non-essential expenses. Thorkild Kristensen from Venstre added more funds to defense and civil defense, which were otherwise only set to increase by 1 percent."	"Neutral"
"2"	1059	1955	12	"Intet menneske vil have fordel af den n√¶ste krig"	"Berlingske Tidende"	"1955-12-2"	"Not particularly relevant. The head of the American civil defense, Val Peterson, is visiting Denmark to inspect civil defense columns across the country. He is generally satisfied with Denmark's civil defense, although, of course, not everything is complete."	"Positive | Validates"
"3"	1034	1955	12	"USA's civilforsvarschef roser Aarhus-bunker'ne"	"Demokraten (Aarhus)"	"1955-12-4"	"The head of U.S. civil defense, Val Peterson, visited Aarhus with the Danish civil defense chief, Arthur Dahl. Peterson believed that Scandinavia, along with Switzerland, is the best at building shelters. During the visit to Aarhus, Peterson inspected the bunkers under the bus station, which he deemed adequate for protection. Peterson generally believed that a strong civil defense could prolong the duration of a war, which could stop some from starting a war."	"Positive | Validates"
"4"	1086	1955	12	"Fjernstyrede, interkontinentale Atom-Projektiler om 5-10 Aar"	"Jyllands-Posten"	"1955-12-4"	"The head of the American civil defense, Val Peterson, is visiting Aarhus and states that the city's combined shelter and garage facilities, such as the one under the bus station, are excellent. He believes they cannot protect against atomic bombs but also thinks that Aarhus is not a target for atomic or hydrogen bombs. However, the shelters can protect against radioactive fallout and smaller bombs. Peterson considers the Danish civil defense to be good but acknowledges that it still has a long way to go before it is complete. He also mentions that, like in the USA, Denmark struggles to recruit volunteers for civil defense."	"Positive | Validates"
