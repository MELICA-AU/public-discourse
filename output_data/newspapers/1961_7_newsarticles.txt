Additionally, the USA will discuss a reorganization of its civil defense, but denies that this is related to the Berlin problem. The reorganization of the American civil defense plan is intended to make the American public aware of the seriousness of the international situation. The communist leader of East Germany, Walter Ulbricht, is expected to explain their position on the Berlin issue. Western diplomatic circles believe that several measures from East Germany suggest that the East Germans are concerned about the consequences of a separate peace with the Soviet Union. East Germany risks facing an economic blockade from West Germany and possibly other NATO countries if a separate peace is made."	"Neutral"
