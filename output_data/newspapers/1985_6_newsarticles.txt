Denmark’s largest civil defense agreement was reached in 1984 (the year before the article), providing an additional 98 million DKK for the period 1985-1987. These funds are earmarked for improvements in warning systems, telecommunications, shelters, and public information. Elkær-Hansen acknowledges that before this agreement, Civil Defense was on the brink of losing its credibility with the public. He emphasizes the need to recruit more volunteers and to better inform citizens about what they can do themselves to protect themselves in a crisis."	"Positive"
