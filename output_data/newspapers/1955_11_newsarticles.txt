The article is written in the newspaper Land og Folk, which is published by the Danish Communist Party. The article has a clear bias. Writer J.C. criticizes the head of Danish civil defense, Arthur Dahl, for stating that the Danish civil defense has a significant role in the event of an atomic or hydrogen bomb explosion outside the destroyed zone. The writer, on the other hand, believes that civil defense is useless and that the public is unwilling to spend more money on it because it only provides a false sense of security."	"Negative"
"2"	1094	1955	11	"Sålænge der rustes, må civilforsvaret styrkes"	"Horsens Socialdemokrat"	"1955-11-8"	"The Director of Civil Defense, Arthur Dahl, believes that not only cities but also rural citizens should be protected against nuclear weapons. He justifies this by pointing to the range of atomic bombs, the extent of their destruction, and the danger of radioactive fallout. The Vice Chair of the Civil Defense Federation, Majse de Neergaard, states that it is important to focus on training volunteers, improving skills, and strengthening cohesion."	"Positive"
