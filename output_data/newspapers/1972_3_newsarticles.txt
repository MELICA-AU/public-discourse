Kæseler of Brande, who is an ABC Instructor specializing in protection against weapons of mass destruction. Kæseler criticizes the budget committee's proposal to halt the expansion of shelters. He argues that the current shelters are already minimal relative to the population, which will only grow in the future. If the proposal is passed, he believes it will be difficult to comply with the Civil Defense Act. Kæseler points out that the arms race involving nuclear weapons continues, with more countries acquiring them, meaning people still need protection. He notes that even if foreign countries are hit, radioactive fallout could affect Danes. 
To maintain an effective civil defense, he argues, it is essential to build effective shelters and provide factual information about their importance, in coordination with other protective measures. He also believes that strong protection of the civilian population is a crucial element in a preventive defense strategy."	"Different opinions"
