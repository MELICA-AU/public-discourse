"1"	1348	1970	10	"Civilforsvaret svarer på kritikken: Fornem og ansvarsfuld gerning CF påtager sig"	"Frederiksborg Amts Avis"	"1970-10-2"	"In the Helsingør City Council, a proposal was made to cut the Civil Defense's salary expenses in favor of a milk program for schoolchildren. This led to a heated debate, with the Civil Defense being criticized by Kr. Engelsen from the Communist Party, Ove Krog Hansen from the Socialist People's Party, and Niels Overgaard from the Social Liberal Party. Subsequently, the newspaper sought a comment from Helsingør's Civil Defense leader, H.C. Galle. He remarked that the derogatory comments about the work of the Civil Defense personnel are discriminatory. Therefore, he invites the council members who did not vote in favor of the Civil Defense's budget to come and visit the Helsingør Civil Defense. He believes that this would give the council members the right impression of the Civil Defense's work—as something that can save lives, limit, and alleviate damage. Something he believes the council members would appreciate if an attack were to occur."	"Different opinions"
"2"	1261	1970	10	"Beskyttelsesrum i Svendborg fortsat ikke atom-sikrede"	"Fyns Amts Avis"	"1970-10-17"	"The shelters in Svendborg are inadequate for protection against a nuclear war. Six months ago, after Fyns Amts Avis highlighted the insufficiency of the shelters, the National Testing Institute initiated an investigation to determine whether there is gypsum in the concrete of the shelter walls, a concern that has arisen across the country. Civil Defense Agency official S. Ronow has been pushing for the results of the investigation. If it is confirmed that gypsum is present in the concrete, many shelters will need to be inspected and potentially modified."	"Different opinions"
