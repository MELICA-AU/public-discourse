He attributed the slow pace of development to attacks directed at the civil defense agency, noting that much time has been spent investigating the agency's financial affairs. Additionally, the leadership opposes the conscription of people for civil defense personnel, preferring instead to improve conditions for volunteers."	"Problems exist | Wants more CD"
