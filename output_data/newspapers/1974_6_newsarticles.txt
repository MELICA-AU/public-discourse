Interior Minister Jacob Sørensen believes that the Civil Defense Barracks in Padborg will have to be abandoned as of April 1, 1975, due to budget cuts to civil defense. He feels that the cuts have hit civil defense hard, resulting in the halt of the construction of combined public bomb shelters and command centers. The procurement of new equipment and uniforms is very minimal. Additionally, the financial framework for the civil defense regions has been reduced by half, and training activities for conscripts and volunteers in municipal civil defense are significantly limited."
