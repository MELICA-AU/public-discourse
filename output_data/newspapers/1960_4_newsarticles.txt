Instead, the focus should be on banning the atomic bomb and pursuing peace and détente. The writer believes this is a better way to ensure survival than hiding in an underground bunker. The writer disagrees with statements made by the director of the Danish Civil Defense, Arthur Dahl, who claimed that we could survive a nuclear war. The writer believes that such statements create a false sense of security among the public."	"Negative"
