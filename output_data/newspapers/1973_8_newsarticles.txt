He argues that politicians should not cut funding for civil defense, as the current détente does not imply that there isn’t ongoing development of offensive capabilities with nuclear weapons. He believes that politicians are responsible for the safety of the population and that having adequate shelters is crucial. Kæseler asserts that the public is willing to pay for the assurance provided by a well-developed civil defense system."	"Different opinions"
