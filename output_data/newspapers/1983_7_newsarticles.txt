They highlight a disparity in spending, noting that the combined municipal and state civil defense budgets amount to 66 DKK per resident, compared to 1,707 DKK per resident for the military. They see this as a significant mismatch. Despite skepticism, they argue that Civil Defense can make a difference, emphasizing that not everyone would perish in the event of a full-scale nuclear war."
