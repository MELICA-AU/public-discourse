The storm surge preparedness will be twice as effective because it will operate within established structures with permanent equipment and personnel on the island, according to civil defense leader Ole B. Hundahl from Fanø. The civil defense unit needs volunteers, both men and women, particularly for firefighting, rescue services, signal services, and accommodation and catering services, to ensure the civil defense on Fanø operates as efficiently as possible. Additionally, the civil defense units of Fanø and Esbjerg will prepare campaigns about civil defense and recruitment campaigns on Fanø."	"Positive"
