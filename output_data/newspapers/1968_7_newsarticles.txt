Hans Hansen from Skovvangsvej in Aarhus N writes a letter to the editor in connection with the nuclear warning drills taking place across the country. He argues that it is impossible to protect oneself from the consequences of a nuclear war and that efforts should instead focus on preventing it. In the nuclear age, global issues, such as hunger in Africa, are also our problems. He believes that civil defense in the nuclear age cannot be limited to building shelters and signing nuclear non-proliferation treaties, as both provide the public with a false sense of security. He asserts that the public needs to be told the truth about war and that their fear of war must be kept alive to prevent the bomb from being used by the Soviet Union, Europe, or the USA. Hansen believes that international conflict research and aid to developing countries are the proper forms of civil defense in the nuclear age, as global problems are also our problems."	"Negative"
