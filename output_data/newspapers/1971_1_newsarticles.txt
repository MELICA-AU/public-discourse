Frisch, the civil defense leader in Randers, hopes that there will be no need for civil defense but is also optimistic about the effective expansion of civil defense in Randers in 1971. In the coming year, Randers civil defense will focus on four main areas: enhancing professional services, increasing collaboration between Randers civil defense and neighboring municipalities, setting objectives for the organization and readiness of shelters, and conducting a local review of self-protection measures. Additionally, a city analysis will be conducted to assess fire hazards in various parts of the city, examine the distribution of the population and address both residential and workplace locations, and expand the public information efforts."

The mask aims to meet five key requirements: it must be usable by all population groups, provide protection for up to an hour, be easy to put on, be usable with minimal discomfort and no risk, and be affordable. It is planned to determine whether the gas mask meets these five requirements in the near future."	"Positive"
