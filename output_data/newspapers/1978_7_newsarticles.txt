"2"	1289	1978	7	"CIA-rapport om civilforsvaret: Sovjet er ikke usårlig"	"Aarhus Stiftstidende"	"1978-7-20"	"An American CIA report has examined Soviet civil defense. The report concludes that the Soviets have developed an active program for the protection of the civilian population, but still, 100 million people are at risk of being killed. The report does not comment on whether the Soviet Union has the will or the capability to attack the USA. Soviet leaders believe that civil defense can both help in waging nuclear war against the USA and increase the chances of survival in the event of a nuclear attack. However, the report states that the Soviets are unlikely to survive a nuclear war, as they are uncertain about how much civil defense can protect them. The report is published amid a debate in the USA about whether the country should implement a civil defense program to match the Soviet Union. The USA has reduced its civil defense over the past 15 years. Some Americans argue that civil defense would help deter the Soviets from launching a nuclear attack. The report also mentions that there are evacuation plans for Soviet cities, but some cities would take up to a week to evacuate."	"Neutral"
