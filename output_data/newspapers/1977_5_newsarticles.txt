According to the annual report of the Civil Defense Agency, the civil defense is not functioning satisfactorily. There is a shortage of personnel and materials in the local civil defense units, deficiencies in training standards, insufficient coverage with shelters, and shortages in the construction of command centers, barracks, schools, and depots. Additionally, there are gaps in war gas protection and the radio warning network. Due to the 1972 austerity plan, it is not financially feasible to build new combined public shelters, even though there is a shortage of such facilities. The reduction in national civil defense budgets over the years has mainly impacted establishment costs. In the early 1960s, these made up 45 percent of the overall civil defense budget, but by 1975/76, this had fallen to 11 percent, with only 8 percent expected for 1976/77. Currently, civil defense accounts for just 0.22 percent of total state expenditure, which is a third of what it was in 1963/64. Additionally, spending on civil protection is now given lower priority. It accounts for 3.5% of defense expenditures, down from the previous 4.5%. This shift can be explained by the integration of civil defense into the country's peacetime disaster preparedness since 1976. Moreover, the number of volunteers has reached an all-time high in recent years."	"Negative"

There are shortages in equipment and personnel within the local civil defense, as well as \"deficiencies in personnel training standards, inadequate shelter coverage, gaps in command center, barracks, school, and depot construction, and a lack of protection against war gases,\" among other issues.

"8"	1265	1977	5	"Vi har for få beskyttelsesrum"	"Herning Folkeblad"	"1977-5-27"	"Civil defense has produced an annual report showing several deficiencies: inadequate material and personnel coverage in local civil defense, substandard training for members, insufficient coverage in shelters, and shortcomings in command center, barracks, school, and depot construction, as well as lacking war protection. The radio warning network is also not functioning optimally. Currently, shelters cover only 50% of the population, which the Civil Defense Agency deems unsatisfactory. No funds have been allocated for the construction of public shelters in the 1972 financial budget due to austerity measures. Budget cuts to state civil defense funding have impacted establishment costs. In the 1960s, civil defense accounted for 45% of the total civil defense budget; this dropped to 11% in 1975/76 and 8% in 1976/77. Civil defense’s share of government expenditure is now 0.22%, a third of what it was in 1963/64. A similar trend is observed in military defense spending, which has decreased from 4.5% of defense expenditures a decade ago to 3.5% now. This development aligns with the fact that civil defense has been part of the societal peacetime disaster preparedness since 1976, participating far more than before. Additionally, there has been a noted increase in the number of volunteers in civil defense over recent years."	"Different opinions"
