He believes that Denmark would stand little chance in a war and that the population would face hunger if significant resources are allocated to military efforts, as it would result in higher taxes. Hendriksen supports the idea of civil defense but criticizes the lack of options for the public to seek protection in the event of nuclear proliferation or the absence of protective suits. He doubts that Aalborg's citizens would have a chance in the \"prehistoric\" shelters. Therefore, he argues that funds should be directed towards enhancing protection for the population."
