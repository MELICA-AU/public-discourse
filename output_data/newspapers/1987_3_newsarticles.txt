The survey began in October 1986. Firstly, few of those asked responded to the survey. Among those who did, the majority indicated they would leave their workplace to return home to their families. Danish law would be suspended in favor of an emergency law if a disaster occurs or war becomes imminent. Under the emergency law, employees are obligated to stay at their posts. The Greve Peace Group believes this highlights that few people are aware of the civil law/emergency law. Therefore, they argue that public attention must be directed toward this legislation. The group also asserts that war can be avoided, but that the current defense system does not provide effective enough protection—action must be taken before it is too late. The Greve Peace Group criticizes the civil emergency preparedness system as unrealistic and costly, with its requirements for shelters, food, clean water, and medicine for all citizens. Instead, they call for support for disarmament, for Greve to be declared a nuclear-free zone, and for backing the Nordic Council’s efforts to create a nuclear-free Nordic region. They are advocating for a public debate and hearing on the issue."	"Different opinions"
