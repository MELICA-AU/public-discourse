The article is an opinion piece written by the head of Civil Defense, Arthur Dahl.  Dahl speaks about the importance of civil defense, though its expenses seem outrageous to some. He also mentions people who believe that the development of civil defense is progressing too slowly. He defends this by stating that there needs to be a plan for the work first. Additionally, there is a lack of funding to build shelters to cover 25% of the population in densely populated urban areas. Dahl also addresses criticism regarding the personnel's situation, which the civil defense will try to improve. According to Dahl, the civil defense is not yet able to fulfill its tasks. Arthur Dahl also mentioned things that are already functioning well, such as the warning service."	"Validates"
