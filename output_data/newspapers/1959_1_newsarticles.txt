As a result, the Civil Defense Agency is considering drafting personnel from conscripts who draw exemption numbers. Administration Chief E. Schultz explains that far too few people have volunteered for civil defense, particularly in larger cities like Copenhagen, which has only 4,000 volunteers but needs 40,000 (a coverage rate of just 10%). The situation is better in smaller towns. This issue of recruiting enough volunteers for civil defense is also a problem abroad. Schultz mentions that they prefer to draft conscripts who draw exemption numbers rather than drafting from the general population, as this could create unnecessary issues. However, these plans have not yet been implemented and are still under consideration."	"Different opinions"
