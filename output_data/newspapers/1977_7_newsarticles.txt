Two years ago, the state stopped providing subsidies for the additional costs of incorporating public shelters into new buildings. As a result, the Civil Defense Agency has contacted municipalities to identify suitable buildings for converting into public shelters. Haderslev, among others, has begun this process. The nationwide goal is to provide public shelters for 25% of the population in urban areas. Haderslev meets this target, but it is more difficult to fulfill the requirement that the nearest shelter must be no more than 200-300 meters away, which the new initiative will likely help to improve."
