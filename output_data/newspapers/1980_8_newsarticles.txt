He criticizes the Civil Defense for comprising only 60,000 untrained individuals, the insufficient availability of shelters—which would only protect half the population—and the lack of preparedness among doctors, alongside outdated and inadequate medical supplies that he believes should be discarded. Madsen extends his critique to the broader defense framework, finding the military, the Home Guard, and the police equally inadequate. He places significant blame on the Social Democrats, accusing them of failing to ensure a robust defense, both during World War II and in the present day. According to Madsen, the military is constrained by outdated attitudes and unable to utilize its financial resources effectively. He calls for public opposition to the direction in which politicians are leading Denmark’s defense strategy, arguing that this path could result in significant casualties in the event of war. To address these issues, he proposes a national referendum on the defense agreement, allowing the public to push for a change in policy and ensure better preparedness."	"Different opinions"
