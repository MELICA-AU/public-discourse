Byg from the Civil Defense School in Tinglev has visited Norway and will later visit Sweden to examine their civil defense systems. The conclusion is that the Norwegians and Swedes are ahead of Denmark in certain areas. He observed that the Norwegians and Swedes use TV internally for educational purposes, which is not being utilized in Tinglev. L. Byg will prepare a report for the Civil Defense Agency, in which he will describe the Norwegians' design of shelters, which are more advanced than in Denmark. Like Denmark's civil defense, Norway also suffers from budget cuts. Experiences from the Norwegian and Swedish civil defense may potentially be transferred to Denmark following the visit."
