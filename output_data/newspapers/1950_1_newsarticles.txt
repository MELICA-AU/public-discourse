The article discusses how civil defense was hastily constructed during World War II and proved to be inefficient. Now, there is a need to rebuild civil defense from scratch. The writer, Chris, notes that discussions about civil defense, including shelters and rescue services, remind people of World War II and evoke the fear of being thrust into another war soon. However, Chris argues that it is better for Denmark to be prepared with a civil defense system in case war breaks out again."	"Validates | Wants more CD"
