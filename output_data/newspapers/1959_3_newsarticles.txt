Hansen's proposal for enabling legislation (Bemyndigelseslovgivning), which would grant the government additional powers. This proposal, related to civil defense in wartime, also includes authorizations for peacetime. The writer objects to the principle of granting more power to the government but does not dispute the need for improvements in civil defense during wartime. Civil defense leaders have noted that they only achieve 33% of the effectiveness required by the civil defense law. The writer questions whether the government is seeking enabling legislation to avoid further criticism regarding the civil defense's lack of effectiveness."	"Negative"
