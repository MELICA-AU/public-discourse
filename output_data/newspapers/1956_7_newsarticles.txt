Civil defense authorities in these cities were concerned that, according to the law, they must fulfill responsibilities without the state simultaneously providing the necessary resources. The Social Democratic Minister of the Interior, Carl Petersen, could not guarantee the system's effectiveness but spoke of fluctuating attitudes towards civil defense. This leads to a \"what's the use\" (hvad kan det nytte) mentality for some, but not for him. The newspaper also reports that studies showed it was not hopeless to implement measures through civil defense."	"Mixed | Wants more"
