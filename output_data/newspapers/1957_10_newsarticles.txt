Interior Minister Søren Olesen is considering introducing a new civil law. According to the Civil Defense Agency, the 40 million kroner is insufficient for their overall needs but will cover the most significant shortages. Ninety percent of the 40 million is earmarked for various equipment for municipal civil defense units across the country. However, civil defense will still lack funds for research into biological warfare."	"Neutral"
