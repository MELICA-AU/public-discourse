Therefore, Berlingske Tidende asked Erik Schultz, the administration manager at the civil defense authority. He states that civil defense has prioritized other matters and has not yet focused on blackouts. The civil defense expects people to improvise on this front and handle it themselves using items like newspapers or blankets. Additionally, the civil defense has not requested companies to produce blackout curtains, deeming it unnecessary. Schultz mentions that guidelines for blackout curtains will be provided in the future."	"Validates | Wants more CD"

He explained that modern warfare affects civilians as well, and therefore, civilians must band together and try to protect themselves from war. In Esbjerg, the goal is to create shelters for 25% of the population, while the remaining 75% should have space in private and corporate protection facilities. Hansen emphasized that civil defense is seeking men and women to volunteer as personnel under the principle of 'help to self-help'."	"Validates | Wants more CD"
