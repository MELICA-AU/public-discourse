The article details where the music can be heard. The American music company Muzak has produced the music and offered to create a tape with instructions for the population, which could be ready in the event of a disaster. However, the civil defense has declined this offer. The article’s author, Bent Henius, suggests that this rejection might be related to the risk of enemies potentially capturing the radio station."
