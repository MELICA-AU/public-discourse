The reason for the application, according to Nørresundby Mayor Robert Christiansen, is that civil defense equipment from the state cannot be stored safely. He suggests that the storage room should be financed as a loan over the next 10-15 years. The Civil Defense Commission also plans to apply for an even larger grant. The state has set requirements for the municipality to acquire additional types of equipment in connection with the state delivering large quantities of materials to the municipality, which the municipality has fallen behind on fulfilling. Additionally, the state has financed 900,000 DKK for Nørresundby’s municipal civil defense, including 130,000 DKK used for the construction of public shelters. Nørresundby’s municipal civil defense force consists of 700 people."	"Positive"

The case processing in the Ministry of Housing has been prolonged. Additionally, the local civil defense requires that the building include a shelter, which was initially overlooked in the project plans. Furthermore, the project has been put out for bid again because the first offer could not be accepted."	"Neutral"
