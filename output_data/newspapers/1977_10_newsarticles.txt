Riksted from Visse (in Aalborg). He argues that politicians do not prioritize citizens' safety through civil defense sufficiently. Riksted believes that Denmark, compared to other countries, does not invest enough in this area. The defense budget is 24 times larger than the expenditure on civil defense. Riksted argues that civilians would not be spared in a war, making their protection crucial. He expresses dissatisfaction with the state-imposed cuts to civil defense, which amount to 40 million kroner annually. He sees civil defense as a kind of insurance that should safeguard Denmark in a wartime scenario."	"Different opinions"
