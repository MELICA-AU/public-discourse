Editor Knud Bruun-Rasmussen, spoke at a meeting organized by the Svendborg Branch of the Civil Defense Federation. Bruun-Rasmussen believes that an effective civil defense is crucial even in the case of hydrogen bombs, as there will be areas in need of assistance. He questions why there are not more volunteers participating in civil defense. People need to understand that the work being done is significant. By getting involved, they can ease their conscience and perhaps one day save lives. He believes that participating in civil defense is an admirable endeavor. The number of people who consider the work to be ridiculous has decreased."	"Positive"
