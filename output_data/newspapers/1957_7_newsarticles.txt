The writer, Leo, criticizes the civil defense's plan to distribute a pamphlet to the public about the effects of nuclear weapons. Instead, he argues that civil defense should focus on preventing the use of such weapons altogether. Additionally, he criticizes the view that civil defense is an integral part of NATO's military apparatus, which allows it to demand more funding. The Ministry of Finance has approved 35 million for civil defense, while the civil defense demands 45 million."	"Negative"
