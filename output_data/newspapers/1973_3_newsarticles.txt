Now, civil defense takes on more peacetime tasks, such as using the alarm system to warn populations about natural disasters. John E. Davis, the head of the U.S. Civil Defense Preparedness Office, states that people don't expect a nuclear attack to happen. Therefore, civil defense must handle accidents during both peacetime and a potential nuclear war. There is a noticeable lack of interest in building shelters compared to 10 years ago, even though there are still shortages in suburban and rural areas. Psychologists explain that this disinterest is due to people avoiding thoughts of the dangers of a nuclear attack, as the consequences would be so devastating. Additionally, some Americans believe that efforts to protect themselves would reduce the chances of peace, while others think it's impossible to protect against a nuclear attack, or that the likelihood of nuclear war is so small that civil defense is a waste of money. The civil defense has not replenished its food supplies since the 1960s, and they no longer send out protective information to the public, as they believe there will be enough warning time to distribute the necessary information beforehand. Overall, civil defense has not made any concrete plans for its future."	"Different opinions"
