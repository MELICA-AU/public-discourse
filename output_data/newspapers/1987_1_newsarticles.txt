The group believes that the population should have better opportunities for protection and aims to make improved civil protection a public cause. The association’s chairman, parish priest Poul B. Nielsen, argues that Denmark lags behind other countries when it comes to civil protection. He highlights the inadequacy of shelters, pointing out the lack of space and air purification systems to remove radioactive dust and toxic gases. The association sees civil protection as a peacekeeping measure and plans to take action by surveying the emergency plans, shelters, and resources available in different municipalities. Their goal is to advocate for better preparedness and enhanced safety measures nationwide."	"Different opinions"
