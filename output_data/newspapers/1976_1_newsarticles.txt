Hansen from Horsens has taken over a property in Bækkelund, where there is a World War II bunker located on the premises. The annual compensation/rent for the land was set at 75 DKK per year when the bunker was built. Since then, the rent has not been adjusted, which Knud Hansen is dissatisfied with, as he believes the land value and property assessment have increased since that time. He is also uncertain about how to maintain the bunker. Bent Michelsen, Head of Office at the Civil Defense Agency, states that there have been almost no adjustments to the compensation rates for various bunkers since their construction. However, they can now increase it to a maximum of 125 DKK annually, which can happen if the landowner contacts their local civil defense office, which will then forward the application to the Civil Defense Agency. Maintenance of the bunker is the responsibility of the Civil Defense Agency, which often occurs when the landowner themselves contacts Civil Defense regarding it. Additionally, it is not possible to have a bunker removed, as funding for new shelters has ceased. There are approximately 4,000 in Denmark, and they are only removed if they obstruct construction or road work. Landowners are legally obligated to make the land available for these constructions."
