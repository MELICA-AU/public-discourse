Jessen. Nykøbing has been slow to start their civil defense efforts, which Jessen attributes to the town being smaller than, for example, Copenhagen, and therefore given lower priority. He also mentions that they will push to expedite the development of civil defense as quickly as possible."	"Wants more"
