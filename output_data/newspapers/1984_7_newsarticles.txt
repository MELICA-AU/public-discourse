"1"	1491	1984	7	"En ny radikal sikkerhedspolitik"	"Skive Folkeblad"	"1984-7-25"	"This is a statement from Karen Rald from Hvidbjerg as part of a debate on security policy within the Danish Social Liberal Party (Det Radikale Venstre). She argues that there is a public demand for disarmament and d√©tente due to fears of militarization, but such measures can only be achieved through political action, not through peace movements. She believes that Danish security policy must be rethought to prevent Denmark from becoming part of global militarization. The Danish Social Liberal Party therefore proposes a disarmament-focused defense policy and views NATO membership as an increasing threat to Denmark's security, as it is driven by U.S. ambitions. Consequently, Denmark should strive to free itself from great powers and military alliance systems. She also argues that Civil Defense must be expanded and made more effective, particularly regarding warning systems, shelters, fire and rescue services, ambulance services, and hospital preparedness. Additionally, evacuation planning and collaboration with the police should be prioritized. While this would be costly, it would be offset by limiting the tasks of the armed forces to purely defensive roles."	"Different opinions"
