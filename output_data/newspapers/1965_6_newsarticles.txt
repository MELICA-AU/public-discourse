This decision was partly made because conscripts are now being called up for civil defense and will need a place to stay overnight. Director Tage Sørensen did not understand the objections from the Socialist People's Party (SF) and some other city council members who are opposed to civil defense. He believes that the majority of the population supports civil defense. Rolf Lütken views civil defense as part of the military defense but also acknowledges its humanitarian purposes. Peter Bentzen opposes civil defense because it is under military control, while Henning Rasmussen contends that civil defense is not under military control."	"Different opinions"
