"1"	1211	1968	2	"Har 75 procent af CF-styrken en negativ indstilling?"	"Vendsyssel Tidende"	"1968-2-15"	"The article is written by Civil Defense Regional Chief Eskild Smidt from Aalborg. At a contact meeting at the Civil Defense base in Sæby, the chairman of the Civil Defense Cooperation, civil defense leader, and bank clerk II Jeppesen from Skagen expressed that 75% of the conscripted personnel in the cities have a negative attitude toward their service. Smidt disagrees with this view. He argues that it is not surprising when conscripts are compelled to serve and are not volunteers. Experience shows that only a minority of conscripts are directly opposed to the idea of civil defense, and only a few avoid their duties. Smidt believes that most conscripts he has encountered are positive about their service. He suggests that Jeppesen's view might stem from a preference for having civil defense composed solely of volunteers rather than including conscripted personnel as well."	"Different opinions"
