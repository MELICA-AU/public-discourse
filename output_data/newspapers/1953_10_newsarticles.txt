Denmark has built its civil defense based on long-term plans and aims to build public shelters for 25% of the urban population. Annually, 1,000 young men are called up for training in the civil defense corps. The civil defense has expanded with more equipment, effectively doubling the capacity of the country's fire departments. All telephone and radio equipment for civil defense is being tested. Experts believe that 'the Danish Civil Defense has only taken the first steps on a long road.' Since 1950, the state has spent 150 million Danish kroner on civil defense, of which 115 million were for one-time expenses and 70 million for hospital preparedness."
