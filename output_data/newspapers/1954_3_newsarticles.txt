The Director of Civil Defense, Arthur Dahl, has handed over two bunker facilities to the civil defense. One contains the command center for Aarhus, and the other houses the central Jutland district command. Dahl mentions that the civil defense is struggling to recruit volunteers. The article also states that Aarhus has been a pioneer in relation to civil defense. In other cities, it has been believed that Aarhus has been favored by the administration, but this is denied. Aarhus has simply been ahead of the administration's directives at times and has generally made significant progress with development. Aarhus is very likely to receive Denmark's first shelter against direct hits. City Council member Oluf Nielsen says that Aarhus has made rapid progress and has met with goodwill from the civil defense administration."	"Different opinions"
