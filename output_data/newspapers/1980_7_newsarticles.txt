"1"	1478	1980	7	"Et nødråb sendes ud fra civilforsvaret"	"Bornholms Tidende"	"1980-7-29"	"The Civil Defense Directorate has issued a memorandum highlighting numerous shortcomings in civil defense. For example, 60,000 civil defense personnel lack proper training, there is a shortage of shelters and air raid sirens, parts of the firefighting and rescue equipment are outdated and worn out, and uniforms are lacking.  
Preben Steen Nielsen, the Social Democrats' defense spokesperson, argues that it is not possible to allocate more funding to civil defense. However, Niels Anker Kofoed, a member of parliament from the Liberal Party (Venstre), insists that there must be sufficient funding for an effective civil defense system and opposes potential barracks closures, including those on Bornholm. He believes the timing of the memorandum's release is linked to planned budget cuts for 1981."	"Different opinions"
