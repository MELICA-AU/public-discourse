This unit would handle tasks related to planning, administration, and education for society’s disaster and accident response measures—both during peacetime and wartime. Additionally, it is proposed that the Civil Defense Agency and the State Fire Inspection be placed under the Ministry of the Interior and that the compulsory service training period be reduced from 8 to 2 months, with the training relocated to new civil defense barracks. The Department of Administration proposes annual budget cuts of 63 million from 1978/79 onwards. \"The four older civil defense barracks in Thisted, Middelfart, Hillerød, and Allinge are proposed to be closed, and the number of permanent officers and civilian staff is to be reduced by approximately 150.\" The Department of Administration believes that civil defense should be based on disaster response organizations that also operate during peacetime. They therefore propose a local emergency preparedness unit in every municipality, which includes the current municipal civil defense and fire services. The agency also seeks to expand the number of shelters, which currently provide 66% coverage in civil defense areas. Civil Defense Director Erik Schultz opposes the cuts to the civil defense corps, as he believes they would weaken the overall preparedness for both peace and wartime situations. Furthermore, he thinks that savings could be made in areas other than civil defense."	"Different opinions"

The Administration Department proposes in a report to merge the Civil Defense Agency and the State Fire Inspection into a nationwide emergency management agency to save money. The report also suggests reducing conscription training from 8 to 2 months. The total savings would amount to 63 million DKK for 1978/79. 4 Civil defense barracks will be closed and the number of officers and civilian employees would be reduced to 150. Civil defense is expected to function as disaster response organizations that already operate during peacetime. Additionally, the report recommends pursuing an active policy to create more shelters. In all municipalities, a local emergency preparedness unit must be established, encompassing the current municipal civil defense, the fire department, and possibly units from the Danish Rescue Corps. Civil Defense Director E. Schultz believes the proposals in the report would weaken the overall peace- and wartime readiness if the civil defense corps is downsized."	"Different opinions"

Due to a report on Civil Defense from the Ministry of Administration, which recommends a more active policy for new shelters, the Mayor of Copenhagen, Egon Weldekamp, suggests that the old dome bunkers in Copenhagen should be decommissioned and replaced with new shelters. In contrast, Civil Defense Inspector M. Soelberg Larsen from Næstved states that there are no similar initiatives underway in Næstved. Furthermore, the article mentions that there has been considerable vandalism against the bunkers in Næstved, with over 30% of the steel grilles needing replacement."	"Different opinions"
