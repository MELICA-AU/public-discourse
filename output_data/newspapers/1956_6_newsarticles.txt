The article is written in the newspaper Land og Folk, which is published by the Danish Communist Party. The article has a clear bias. The unnamed writer criticizes civil defense for deceiving the public into believing that having a civil defense system is beneficial and for \"swallowing taxpayers' money (sluge skatteydernes penge).\" The writer doubts there is time to follow the civil defense guidelines and does not believe in their effectiveness. They argue that if a bomb were to fall on Hamburg, it is likely that one would also fall on Denmark. The writer calls for peaceful coexistence and the prohibition of such \"evil.\""	"Negative"
"2"	1098	1956	6	"Det kniber stadig med at skaffe frivillige"	"Lolland-Falsters Stiftstidende"	"1956-6-28"	"Station Manager Axel Petersen, who is the chair of the Civil Defense Federation's Maribo branch, reported at a meeting that the branch is struggling to recruit volunteers, necessitating a reassessment of their approach. Petersen noted that although some believe the development of civil defense is progressing too slowly, Denmark is ahead of other NATO countries in this regard. He emphasized that a civil defense is essential in modern warfare, where the civilian population could be severely impacted."	"Positive | Validates"
