"2"	1176	1966	2	"Breve fra læserne: Om sag nr. 14"	"Vestkysten"	"1966-2-26"	"The article is a lengthy opinion piece by librarian Per Deskov from Esbjerg, responding to a letter to the editor by V.B. Leervad from Vejen, which was previously published in Vestkysten (a newspaper). In his letter, V.B. Leervad responded to an earlier op-ed by Per Deskov (as seen in 1163), which is the subject of Deskov's comments in this article. Deskov argues that civil defense is not just a humanitarian organization but is also connected to military buildup as a military support corps, a claim Leervad considers false. Deskov disagrees with Leervad's letter and believes that Leervad is anti-communist. Furthermore, Deskov disagrees with Leervad’s view that Deskov and other members of the Socialist People's Party are trying to undermine public trust in civil defense. Deskov still sees civil defense as part of military buildup, particularly due to an agreement from 1956 between civil defense and the military, stating that civil defense is obligated to protect military installations. Deskov argues that this agreement is kept secret from the public, which contradicts the recommendations of the Red Cross Committee and makes it difficult for conscientious objectors to realize that by joining civil defense, they are actually supporting the military. Deskov believes that under this cooperation agreement, the military could control civil defense in a wartime situation, a point on which Leervad disagrees. Thus, Deskov is not against civil defense but believes that the military and civil defense should be completely separate."	"Different opinions"
