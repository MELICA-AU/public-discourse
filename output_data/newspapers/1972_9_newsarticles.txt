The Civil Defense aims to change that. The article features Civil Defense leader, engineer Arne Årøe, and explains how the Civil Defense operates. For example, it highlights that the Civil Defense is intended to assist in disaster situations, which is why they have developed an emergency preparedness plan. Additionally, the article mentions that in a mobilization scenario, everyone aged 16–65 residing in Denmark could be called up, provided they are not already in the military. The article primarily focuses on the Civil Defense in Esbjerg. It also discusses protective shelters, which can serve dual purposes as combined shelters; for instance, they may be used as parking garages during peacetime. Furthermore, there are secure rooms in buildings constructed since 1950 with more than two rental units, or in companies with more than 10 employees."	"Different opinions"
