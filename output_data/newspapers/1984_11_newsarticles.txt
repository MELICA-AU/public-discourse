Civil protection is lagging behind, and a consensus has been reached that action is needed. Currently, only 129 out of 275 municipalities are required to establish shelters in buildings of a certain size (shelter obligations in urban zones). In the remaining 146 municipalities, the civilian population lacks adequate protection, a result of state budget cuts in 1975. Former Minister of the Interior from the Social Democrats, Henning Rasmussen, believes this situation is unfavorable for residents in the 146 municipalities, as modern warfare also affects civilians. The 129 municipalities with shelter obligations were previously designated civil defense areas, which explains their requirements. However, the Defense Command now believes that all parts of Denmark are at risk. As a result, there is a push to introduce shelter obligations in all municipalities. Interior Minister Britta Schall Holberg has stated that \"improvements must be achieved without increasing overall costs for builders, and therefore, an adjustment of expenses for shelter construction must be made.\" The agreement has not yet been implemented but is expected to be adopted by the government parties, the Social Democrats, and the Danish Social Liberal Party. Meanwhile, the Socialist People's Party opposes it. Anne Grete Holmsgaard, spokesperson for the Socialist People's Party, criticizes the initiative as a complete scam, arguing that civil defense offers no real protection for the population and suffers from significant shortcomings. Additionally, the article mentions that politicians at Christiansborg have also debated women's studies, though this is unrelated to civil defense."	"Different opinions"
