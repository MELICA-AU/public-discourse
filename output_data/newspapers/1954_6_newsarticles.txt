Civil defense organizations in various Western countries do not believe that the hydrogen bomb has rendered civil defense obsolete. However, civil defense is currently too weak. Local civil defense units, composed of volunteers, are insufficient in both number and quality, and the training is not adequate. Building an effective civil defense will require time, significant funding, and extensive effort before Denmark achieves a satisfactory level of resistance in the event of war. This goal will only be reached after several years."	"Problems exist | Wants more CD"
