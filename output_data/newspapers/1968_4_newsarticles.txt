The manager of a retirement and care home has prohibited the installation of warning sirens at the facility because many of the residents are heart patients. She has banned the workers from entering to connect the siren to the power supply. She is supported by Mayor Vilhelm Dupont. The newspaper questions whether the siren needs to be installed at the care home and suggests it could easily be placed elsewhere. The public supports the manager and the mayor rather than the civil defense in this matter."	"Negative"
