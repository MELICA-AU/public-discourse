Their main goal is to address people in Thy who are concerned about the growing arms race and the increasing danger of nuclear war. They also raise questions about whether civil defense and shelters could be effective in the event of a nuclear war. 500 people in Thy have signed a petition urging the government and Parliament to work for a nuclear-free Nordic region, which Jensen sees as an indication of growing interest in these issues. The group will also review the book Myths About Our Security by Jan Ørberg to provide factual knowledge for the debate. The group does not follow any specific political line but seeks to foster a discussion about whether there will be life on Earth in 25 years."	"Different opinions"

She does not believe that shelters provide protection in the event of war—especially not in the case of a nuclear war, where she believes nothing can be done. She argues that the solution is not to build private shelters, like in the USA. According to her, the only solution is to say no to nuclear weapons worldwide."	"Negative"
