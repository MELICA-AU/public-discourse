According to the annual report of the Civil Defense Agency, the civil defense is not functioning satisfactorily. There is a shortage of personnel and materials in the local civil defense units, deficiencies in training standards, insufficient coverage with shelters, and shortages in the construction of command centers, barracks, schools, and depots. Additionally, there are gaps in war gas protection and the radio warning network. Due to the 1972 austerity plan, it is not financially feasible to build new combined public shelters, even though there is a shortage of such facilities. The reduction in national civil defense budgets over the years has mainly impacted establishment costs. In the early 1960s, these made up 45 percent of the overall civil defense budget, but by 1975/76, this had fallen to 11 percent, with only 8 percent expected for 1976/77. Currently, civil defense accounts for just 0.22 percent of total state expenditure, which is a third of what it was in 1963/64. Additionally, spending on civil protection is now given lower priority. It accounts for 3.5% of defense expenditures, down from the previous 4.5%. This shift can be explained by the integration of civil defense into the country's peacetime disaster preparedness since 1976."	"Negative"

He fears that the Civil Defense will lose its credibility and that municipalities will be reluctant to invest in and expand the local Civil Defense. He believes that Civil Defense is important both in peacetime and during wartime situations. Furthermore, he argues that expanding shelters is necessary, as they are the best possible means of protection against radioactive radiation."	"Different opinions"
