Journalist David Jens Adler writes in the article that an effective civil defense is expensive, and it is irresponsible to make the public believe that cheap, improvised measures can make any significant difference. He believes that civil protection can save many lives and is therefore important, but the chances of success are slim, even with a well-developed civil defense. A good civil defense could be very costly, which might change public opinion about it. The article was written in connection with the USA increasing funding for the development and production of chemical and biological weapons."	"Different opinions"
"2"	1135	1961	4	"Breve fra l√¶serne: Dansk samling og Atomprotestanterne"	"Jyllands-Posten"	"1961-4-27"	"Important.The article is a letter to the editor from civil engineer and General Secretary of Dansk Samling, Knud P. Pedersen. He argues that, for example, the anti-nuclear protest movement does not have a war-preventive effect. Instead, he is convinced that it creates an atmosphere of fear through scare tactics by claiming that a bomb will kill everyone. This, he believes, fosters a public sentiment that makes defense impossible and undermines the development of an effective civil defense. A well-organized civil defense could save many thousands of lives. He calls on people to support the fight against \"tyranny, poverty, and superficiality.\""	"Positive"
