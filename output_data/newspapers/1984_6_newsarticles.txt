"1"	1416	1984	6	"Beredskabsdebat?"	"Berlingske Tidende"	"1984-6-25"	"The article is written by state-authorized accountant Otto Bjerrum, who argues that Denmark must prepare for crisis situations. He discusses the 1962 public pamphlet \"If War Comes,\" noting that it was mocked by the political left in the revue \"Gris på gaflen\" (Pig on a Fork) and in a conflict on the television program \"Gamle Danmark\" about who should supply minced meat (minutkød). Bjerrum highlights that the state has now issued a new pamphlet titled \"On Surviving, (Om at overleve)\" but it has not garnered much public interest. He believes it was a mistake not to distribute the pamphlet directly to households, as it provides valuable preparedness information without inciting fear and could benefit many. Bjerrum also points to Switzerland, with its well-developed civil defense system, as a strong example Denmark could emulate."	"Different opinions"
