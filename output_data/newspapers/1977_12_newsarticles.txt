There are no plans in place to assist the citizens of Fredensborg-Humlebæk Municipality if the Swedish nuclear power plant, Barsebäck, were to explode. The Organization for Information on Nuclear Power (OOA) has prompted the mayor to clarify the situation through their inquiries. Mayor and chairman of the municipality's Civil Defense Commission, Ole Retoft, believes the risk of an explosion is low. Additionally, he does not know if there are any stockpiles of iodine tablets. The article also mentions that the municipality is setting up shelters beneath all schools, kindergartens, and other institutions."	"Different opinions"
