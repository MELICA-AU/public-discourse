He references statements made by Colonel P.J. Jørgensen, who expressed concern that the countries of the Warsaw Pact are all practicing chemical warfare, highlighting that it is alarming that the army’s combat units lack protective suits. Gervin argues that it is equally important to address the civilian population’s protection against gas attacks, as the Civil Defense also lacks sufficient protective equipment. The state Civil Defense Corps possesses new, effective protective suits for all. In contrast, the municipal Civil Defense is equipped with worn-out gas masks from before World War II, no protective suits, and outdated operational uniforms. Gervin also points out that many shelters are not secured against chemical or radioactive agents—and in some cases, not even against conventional weapons. He hopes that the military and politicians will recognize the importance of protecting civilians and see Civil Defense as an integral part of comprehensive national defense. Gervin is optimistic about the Civil Defense agreement under which the organization operates. However, he finds it puzzling that the civilian population insures themselves against many things but does not consider investing in a shelter as a form of insurance against war. He views Civil Defense as a resource that can also assist in everyday life during peacetime."	"Different opinions"
