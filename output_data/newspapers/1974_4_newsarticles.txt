"2"	1397	1974	4	"Spareplanen medførte store indskrænkninger"	"Horsens Folkeblad"	"1974-4-26"	"In 1973, significant budget cuts were made to the civil defense, forcing the Civil Defense Association to adapt to the new financial constraints. Construction of combined shelters was halted, as was the setup of training facilities and command centers. Procurement of new equipment and uniforms was minimal, training activities within municipal civil defense were low, and the service period in the Civil Defense Corps was reduced from 10 to 8 months. However, the chairman, Operations Chief H.P. Helckendorff of the Horsens district, noted that civil defense efforts in peacetime disaster response had been further developed. The state funding for 1973-74 was 200,000 kroner less than in 1972-73. Inga Andersen, leader of the Danish Women's Readiness Association in Horsens, mentioned in the article that the volunteer women in Horsens had made an effective contribution. She also noted that due to budget cuts, no additional training opportunities were offered to the existing ambulance team."	"Different opinions"
