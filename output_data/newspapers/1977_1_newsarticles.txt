Vest-eksperter: Sovjets civilforsvar imponerer ikke"	"Aarhus Stiftstidende"	"1977-1-18"	"The article discusses how Soviet civil defense is viewed with skepticism by both Western diplomats and Russians, despite having a well-developed civil defense plan and shelters. Additionally, there is uncertainty about whether the Soviet Union has an advantage over the United States, as the U.S. claims. Unnamed Western military sources believe that the Soviet civil defense evacuation plans contribute to an exaggerated perception of the effectiveness of their civil defense system."
