However, the article argues that the majority lack knowledge about civil defense, particularly the local aspects. Civil Defense Leader Erik Hededal believes this lack of knowledge is the reason the civil defense struggles to recruit enough volunteers. As a result, the local civil defense is planning a demonstration exercise to spread awareness about civil defense to the public. Hededal believes that a civil defense system is valuable, as it could be very useful in the event of a limited attack on Ringsted. The town is advanced in building up its civil defense, striving to keep costs down as efficiently as possible. However, Hededal notes that Ringsted is lacking public shelters in the inner city, as well as a civil defense facility (CF-g√•rd)."	"Different opinions"
