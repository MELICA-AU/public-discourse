"2"	1053	1952	10	"Principperne for civilforsvarets opbygning i Danmark"	"Nationaltidende"	"1952-10-12"	"The head of the Danish civil defense, Arthur Dahl, believes that the civil defense is not yet able to fulfill its tasks and still has a long way to go. It will require both time and significant funding. The civil defense has focused on rescue equipment and structural protection. As a result, the organization and education of the population have been prioritized secondly. Dahl believes that 90% of the criticism of the civil defense is directed at the personnel side and the volunteers, but the civil defense is working to address this now. Additionally, Dahl calls for the entire population to recognize the important significance of the civil defense and to overcome the discomfort associated with war-related measures."
