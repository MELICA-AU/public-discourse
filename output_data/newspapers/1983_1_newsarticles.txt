Beck expresses skepticism about the Civil Defense's ability to protect the civilian population in the event of a nuclear war. He believes that Civil Defense has its value in smaller-scale disasters, such as pollution control, but questions whether it will receive the necessary funding to build shelters or improve existing, outdated ones. Beck also doubts the Civil Defense Agency's attempts to treat casualties on the battlefield. Overall, he argues that efforts should be focused on preventing war altogether, as civil protection or medical treatment would be ineffective if nuclear weapons are unleashed."	"Negative"
