"2"	1145	1963	4	"Ved et 25 aars jubilæum: Ekstra mandskab til byernes civilforsvar"	"Aarhus Stiftstidende"	"1963-4-27"	"On May 1st, the civil defense marks its 25th anniversary. Young men are now being conscripted into civil defense due to the new civil defense law. This move aims to address the shortage of personnel in cities, where voluntary participation has been insufficient. The article also notes that most Danes understand that a disaster would be worse if Denmark is unprepared to withstand the destruction. Civil defense is not deemed useless, and efforts will be made to address the issues surrounding the public gas mask and the acquisition of radiation detectors."	"Different opinions"
