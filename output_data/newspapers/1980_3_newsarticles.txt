He calls for a broader debate on total defense, emphasizing that civil defense should not be viewed in isolation from the country’s overall defense strategy. Holm is particularly dissatisfied with the state of civil defense, highlighting the lack of bomb shelters as a significant issue—especially in new residential areas. However, he notes that civil defense lacks the financial resources to address the problem. On a positive note, Holm commends the establishment of a 12,000-strong auxiliary force in Region II, where he serves as chief, encompassing Aarhus, Viborg, and Ringkøbing counties. While he believes Denmark’s situation does not differ significantly from that of other Western countries, he acknowledges that Norway and Sweden benefit from protective advantages due to their terrain."
