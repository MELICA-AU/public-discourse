The Civil Defense Federation in Skagen held a meeting attended by only 28 people. Section Chief Captain Hein stated that civil defense is not popular, attributing this perhaps to the shortcomings of wartime air defense, though he emphasized that this has changed now. Hein believes that most people might think they will enlist when war comes, but by then it will be too late. While civil defense is primarily voluntary, conscription may become necessary if enough people do not volunteer. The leader of the Skagen Aid Service, Mayor A.M. Nielsen, mentioned that some may not see the usefulness of civil defense, but he affirmed that it is indeed valuable, even against atomic bombs. Nielsen also noted that people who have not participated in civil defense might feel guilty if war breaks out and their loved ones are harmed. Police Chief Fugl especially encouraged women to enlist in the DKB. The article concludes by urging people to volunteer."	"Wants more"
