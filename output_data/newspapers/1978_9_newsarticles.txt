However, due to budget constraints, this option was not feasible, but they found another temporary solution. There has also been vandalism at the Civil Defense facility in Ørbæk, where someone has ransacked drawers, torn apart storage cabinets, and smeared red paint on the walls. Additionally, they have been dealing with a flood that has damaged the flooring in the command center."	"Different opinions"
