This commission will handle tasks related to both civil defense and the fire commission. The adopted civil defense regulations specify that the preparedness commission must, among other things, develop plans for the organization and scope of the municipality’s civil defense, an emergency preparedness plan, and a plan for dividing residential areas into protective units. Additionally, the commission is tasked with drafting proposals for construction programs aimed at civil defense purposes and the emergency preparedness design of public shelters."	"Neutral"
