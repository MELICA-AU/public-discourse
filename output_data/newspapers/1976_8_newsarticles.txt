The book has sparked a debate regarding the credibility of Western nuclear defense effectiveness. According to the book, the Soviets spend 6 billion dollars on civil defense matters. Publications in the UK suggest that, as a result, the Soviet Union may not be as vulnerable to a nuclear attack from the West as previously assumed. This raises concerns because it challenges the West's belief in the so-called \"balance of terror,\" which has been based on the idea that mutually assured destruction of vital infrastructure would deter nuclear attacks."

"2"	1312	1976	8	"Landsomfattende katastrofetab på vej"	"Jyllands-Posten"	"1976-8-31"	"The Administration Department proposes in a report to merge the Civil Defense Agency and the State Fire Inspection into a nationwide emergency management agency, focusing on societal disasters. Civil defense and fire services will be placed under one ministry, most likely the Ministry of the Interior. The report also suggests reducing conscription training from 8 to 2 months at civil defense barracks in Herning, Haderslev, and Næstved. The total savings would amount to 63 million DKK for 1978/79. Civil defense barracks in Thisted, Middelfart, Hillerød, and Allinge, along with the number of officers and civilian employees, would be reduced to 150. Civil defense is expected to function as disaster response organizations that already operate during peacetime. Additionally, the report recommends pursuing an active policy to create more shelters. Civil Defense Director E. Schultz believes the proposals in the report would weaken the overall peace- and wartime readiness if the civil defense corps is downsized."	"Different opinions"

The report also suggests that civil defense should function as an emergency preparedness force, even in peacetime, implement a more proactive policy on constructing more shelters, and merge the State Fire Inspection and Civil Defense Agency into a single authority. The Mayor of Hillerød, Toke Stokholm, intends to fight to keep the Hillerød barracks operational. He believes that the barracks’ central location is crucial for protecting Greater Copenhagen and safeguarding Frederiksborg County."	"Different opinions"
