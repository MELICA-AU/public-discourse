In peacetime, it will be used for garages and car services. The garage facility is owned by mason (murermester) Anker Jacobsen and the Danish Civil Defense but will be transferred to the Aarhus Municipality after 50 years. It is the first shelter in Denmark to meet the civil defense's requirements for wall and ceiling thicknesses. The underground facility cost 1 million kroner, with the civil defense contributing 600,000 kroner. The civil defense in Aarhus is led by Civil Engineer C.V. Schmidt-Hansen."	"Positive"
