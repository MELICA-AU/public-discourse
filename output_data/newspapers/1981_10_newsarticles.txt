He criticizes the fact that civil defense was not mentioned in the defense agreement and questions whether the politicians will allocate the necessary funds to ensure an effective civil defense system. Hansen believes that while politicians may not be indifferent to the protection of the civilian population, it may appear that way to many people. He calls for a public debate on the country's ability to provide civil protection."	"Different opinions"
