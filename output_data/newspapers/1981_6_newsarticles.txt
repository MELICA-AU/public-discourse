The city council’s request follows inquiries from various organizations—among them Folk for Fred (People for Peace), which asked how sufficient shelter spaces would be provided. Local politician Gunnar Holm argues that additional shelters would be of no use if a missile were to strike the area, as nothing could offer protection in such a scenario. Additionally, the organization OOA (Information on Nuclear Power) has raised concerns about the East German nuclear plant in Lubmin and its lack of safety measures. They also criticize the absence of contingency plans for Lolland-Falster in the event of an accident in East Germany. The article notes that politicians, authorities, and the media have focused heavily on the Barsebäck nuclear power plant in Sweden while largely neglecting the risks associated with the Lubmin facility."
