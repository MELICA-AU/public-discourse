"8"	1321	1970	9	"Aalborgs befolkningstæthed registreres time for time"	"Aalborg Stiftstidende"	"1970-9-18"	"The civil defense plans to conduct an analysis of Aalborg to ensure better preparedness in both peacetime and wartime. The analysis will examine population density on an hourly basis to assess the scope of a potential evacuation, and certain neighborhoods will be evaluated based on fire risk. This study will take about a year. Inspired by his study trip to the U.S., Aalborg’s civil defense chief, A.P. Tage, aims to carry out a basement analysis to register all cellars that could be used as shelters in Aalborg. Initially, civil defense in Denmark intended to conduct a similar survey by sending questionnaires to households, but this project never materialized. Participants on the U.S. trip were also inspired by the American use of private organizations in civil defense, which enhanced its overall efficiency."	"Positive"

"10"	1299	1970	9	"Ikke meget at lære hos det amerikanske civilforsvar"	"Dagbladet"	"1970-9-21"	"Thirty-three civil defense personnel, including Ringsted’s civil defense leader Erik Hededal and the chairwoman of the Danish Women's Preparedness (DBK), Edith Nielsen, spent a month traveling in the USA. Hededal believes that Denmark and the USA's civil defense systems are based on different premises, meaning there is less that can be directly applied to Denmark. The USA focuses on atomic bomb attacks, while Denmark focuses on conventional attacks and smaller tactical nuclear bombs. The trip was organized by the Civil Defense Agency and the People to People organization.
Hededal noted that Americans are more positive about civil defense than Danes. In Denmark, volunteers are pre-trained, whereas the USA relies on volunteers stepping up in a crisis. The US civil defense also has a broader role, including handling natural disasters, which makes the American public more appreciative, as they see the benefits of civil defense. Furthermore, command centers in the USA are used more frequently, unlike in Denmark, where they often remain empty. Hededal emphasized the importance of the American use of command centers and expressed interest in the basement analyses conducted in the US, something Denmark has not done.
Finally, Hededal mentioned that Danish civil defense serves as a model for West Germany, and added that the Americans envy Denmark for having independently organized forces."	"Positive"
"11"	1386	1970	9	"Også her kan vi lære af amerikanerne: I USA kan alle komme i dækning"	"Amtsavisen"	"1970-9-23"	"Civil Defense leader P.-H. Frisch from Randers has returned from a five-week study trip to the USA with 32 other Danish civil defense personnel. He believes that the U.S. is far ahead in terms of their protective shelters, as Denmark can only cover about half of its population, while the U.S. can cover approximately 100%. Additionally, Americans are better informed about where to find these shelters. Frisch also feels that the public sector is more supportive of Civil Defense in the U.S. than in Denmark. Specifically, the visit will inspire a nationwide basement analysis and legislation to clearly mark all protective shelters, similar to what is done in peacetime. Furthermore, Frisch hopes to expand the command centers so they can be utilized in daily operations and to address the supply issues, ensuring that the shelters can be activated at a moment's notice."

Weiler Madsen. Hededal writes that the issues faced by Danish civil defense differ from those in the U.S. The U.S. primarily anticipates nuclear attacks, whereas Danish civil defense considers conventional explosive and incendiary bombs, \"smaller\" nuclear weapons, direct military actions such as artillery shelling, and radiation risks from radioactive fallout both from attacks in Denmark and abroad. The U.S. focuses on warning systems, communication chains, and shelters against radiation hazards, as well as basement analyses, while Denmark also needs to prioritize tactical response teams for fire and rescue services, ambulance services, and more. The U.S. has progressed further with shelters compared to Denmark, which lacks sufficient shelters. In Denmark, there are shelters for 1,710,000 people. Denmark lacks the funds to conduct a basement analysis similar to that of the U.S."	"Different opinions"
