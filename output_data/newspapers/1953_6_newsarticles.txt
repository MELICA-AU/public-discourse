Somewhere in Aalborg, their civil defense district command station is complete but still needs 54 women and 24 men as helpers to staff it. They are to be recruited over the summer. The command station is equipped with telephones, radios, a switchboard, an air conditioning system, and a power station. The station is responsible for covering the area from Mariager Fjord to Skagen and from Kattegat to the North Sea, where residents will be warned of potential air raids or receive help from civil defense if disaster strikes. The station can operate with emergency lighting if it loses power from the Aalborg electricity company. Additionally, it takes 2 times 30 seconds from when an observer spots an enemy plane to when the threatened cities' command stations can warn citizens with sirens. The work on the station's setup is led by the section chief of the civil defense corps, district inspector B.G. Stolpe."	"Positive"
