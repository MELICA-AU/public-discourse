One of the initiative’s founders is folk high school teacher (højskolelærer) Rex Schade. The group held an event at Ryslinge Folk High School (Ryslinge Højskole), where A.B. Larsen from Civil Defense on Funen—though not a member of the peace group—was among the participants.  
During the event, Larsen confirmed that there are not enough bomb shelters for everyone in Denmark, leaving 2,300,000 people without protection. He acknowledged that some areas would be unsurvivable in the event of a nuclear strike but emphasized that bomb shelters and civil defense efforts would help save civilian lives.  
Larsen expressed dissatisfaction with a 20-million-kroner budget cut to civil defense in 1981. He argued that such cuts make no sense in this critical area, warning they would lead to the closure of barracks and staff layoffs.  
However, some young attendees criticized Larsen for not addressing the long-term effects of radiation sufficiently. Larsen responded by admitting that little is currently known about the lasting consequences of radiation exposure."	"Different opinions"
