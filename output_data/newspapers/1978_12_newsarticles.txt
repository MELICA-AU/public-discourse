Congressman Les Aspin (Democrat from Wisconsin) argues that the Soviet civil defense preparedness is not as strong as previously believed. An unnamed member of Congress, who opposes increased funding for civil defense, claims that a nuclear attack by the U.S. on the Soviet Union would kill at least 40 million Russians and destroy more than 60% of the country's industry. The Carter administration has announced plans to improve civil defense readiness, but Aspin believes that this is neither a good idea nor necessary. Secretary of Defense Harold Brown recommends doubling the civil defense budget from $97 million, based on the belief that the Soviet Union has made greater efforts in civil defense."	"Neutral"
"2"	1399	1978	12	"En våd sommer gav færre ildebrande"	"Jydske Tidende"	"1978-12-31"	"There were fewer fires in Vojens Municipality in 1978 compared to the previous year, which can be attributed to increased rainfall and a growing awareness of fire prevention. Additionally, there has been a rise in pollution incidents, likely due to more frequent reporting. Nationally, discussions about the future of civil defense took place in 1978, with efforts focused on achieving savings without weakening preparedness—a goal that, according to Fire Inspector H.E. Høyer, will only be confirmed as successful in 1979. Locally, there have been drills and training sessions for volunteers and conscripts, the development of a new evacuation plan in cooperation with the police, and the civil defense is nearly fully equipped in terms of materials."
