City Engineer Erik Schultz from Svendborg believes that there is widespread apathy and ignorance regarding civil defense in Denmark. He criticizes private shelters for not being sufficiently well-equipped and points out the lack of solutions for a large number of single-family houses without basements. Director of the Civil Defense Authority Erik Schultz (not the same person as the aforementioned) responds to the criticism by stating that it would be an insurmountable task to build shelters for the entire population. He also notes that, during the current extended period of peace, the civilian population cannot maintain a long-lasting interest in civil defense."	"Different opinions"
